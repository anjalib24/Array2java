In Java, an anonymous array refers to an array that is created and initialized in a single statement without assigning it to a variable. This is often used in situations where the array is needed temporarily and does not need to be referenced after its initial use.

Here are a few examples:

### Example 1: Passing an Anonymous Array as a Parameter

You can use an anonymous array when calling a method that requires an array as an argument:

```java
public class Example {
    public static void printArray(int[] array) {
        for (int value : array) {
            System.out.println(value);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printArray(new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}); // Anonymous array
    }
}
```

In this example, `new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` creates an anonymous array that is passed directly to the `printArray` method.

### Example 2: Initializing an Array Directly

You can also use an anonymous array for initialization in other contexts, like setting values in a collection:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; // Not exactly anonymous, but directly initialized
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers));
    }
}
```

While this example is not strictly an anonymous array, it illustrates the concept of creating and initializing an array in a single statement. For truly anonymous arrays, you often see them used directly in method calls or as part of inline initialization.

### Example 3: Creating an Anonymous Array in an Array Initialization

You can use anonymous arrays in scenarios where you initialize arrays of arrays, like so:

```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] matrix = {
            {1, 2, 3},
            {4, 5, 6},
            {7, 8, 9}
        }; // Array of arrays with anonymous sub-arrays

        for (int[] row : matrix) {
            System.out.println(Arrays.toString(row));
        }
    }
}
```

In this case, each sub-array (`{1, 2, 3}`, `{4, 5, 6}`, `{7, 8, 9}`) is an anonymous array used to initialize the `matrix` array.

Anonymous arrays are typically used for their convenience when you don't need to reuse the array elsewhere.
